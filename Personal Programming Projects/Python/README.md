# Python Projects

## Introduction

Since I began programming, Python has been my most trusted tool for creating statistical models. This personal preference is more due to the ease of use and understandability than due to the wide range of applications that it can be used for. In this section I will summarise some of my favourite projects I have worked on so far. 

# Project Examples

## Data Science
[<h3 align = "left">Project: Madrid House Price Prediction</h3>](https://github.com/FernandoOCC/PersonalProjects/tree/main/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python/Madrid%20Real%20Estate%20Price%20Prediciton)

**House Prices as a measure of Consumer Preferences.** The rapid urban growth in Madrid growth in the city of Madrid has lead to a mismatch between the physical characteristics of the city's homes and the expectations of its citizens. This project seeks to use the house prices of more than 19,000 homes advertised in real-estate websites to determine if the ratio of bedrooms to home size (in M2) is a significant determinant in purchasing decisions. This variable was chosen due to the recent decreases in the number of persons living each household, which might change the preferred number of bedrooms per home.
#### Project At A Glance
- The average age of Madrid's housing stock is 56 years, this gives us reason to believe that the characteristics of Madrid's homes do not fully cater for the needs and expectations of Madrid's citizens. By estimating the relative influence of the independent variable: "Ratio of Bedrooms to Home Size" on the dependent variable: "Advertised Price of Homes" we should be able to see if the layout of Madridâ€™s homes is playing a significant role in its citizens purchasing decisions.  This information could be used to justify future investments in home refurbishments. 
- Project Tools: **Python** (libraries: sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib), **SQLServer**.
- Dataset: [Madrid Real Estate Market](https://www.kaggle.com/mirbektoktogaraev/madrid-real-estate-market/) [(21,742  rows, 58 columns 8 MB)](https://www.kaggle.com/mirbektoktogaraev/madrid-real-estate-market/)

#### Project At A Glance
- EDA Project exploring real student data in a college kinematics course. Data has been de-identified.
- Goal: Explore characteristics that could potentially impact a student's physics grade and understanding of Newtonian Mechanics
- Alternative Project: [Early Student Failure Detection Algorithm](https://github.com/FernandoOCC/PersonalProjects/edit/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python/Data%20Science/Early%20Student%20Failure%20Detection%20Algorithm/README.md)
