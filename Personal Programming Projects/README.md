# Programming Projects



### About Me
I was introduced to programming towards the latter of my masterâ€™s in economics program. I learned how to use Python to compute the cost of climate change abatement measures and write reports on this topic. This branch of Economics is known as Environmental Economics and it intends to calculate the economic impacts of policies which regulate environmental issues such as: "Air pollution, water quality, and global warming".  From here I expanded my programming skills for Data Analysis by performing several data science projects. ([Link To My Work](https://github.com/FernandoOCC/PersonalProjects/Data Science)). 

I've grown a love for programming over the years and have tried out data analysis projects, software development projects and web development projects. This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've done as a programmer. Currently categorized by programming language and sub-categorized by project type.
