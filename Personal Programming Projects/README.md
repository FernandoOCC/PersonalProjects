# Python Projects

## Introduction

Since I began programming, Python has been my most trusted tool for creating statistical models. This personal preference is more due to the ease of use and understandability than due to the wide range of applications that it can be used for. In this section I will summarise some of my favourite projects I have worked on so far. 

# Project Examples

## Data Science
[<h3 align = "left">Project: Madrid House Price Prediction</h3>](https://github.com/FernandoOCC/PersonalProjects/tree/main/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Madrid%20House%20Price%20Prediction)
<h4 align=center> Price Predictions </h4>

**House Prices as a measure of Consumer Preferences.** The rapid urban growth in Madrid growth in the city of Madrid has lead to a mismatch between the physical characteristics of the city's homes and the expectations of its citizens. This project seeks to use the house prices of more than 19,000 homes advertised in real-estate websites to determine if the ratio of bedrooms to home size (in M2) is a significant determinant in purchasing decisions. This variable was chosen due to the recent decreases in the number of persons living each household, which might change the preferred number of bedrooms per home.
#### Project At A Glance
- The APACHE (Acute Physiological And Chronic Health Evaluation) IV/IVa is a tool used to risk-adjust ICU patients for ICU performance benchmarking and quality improvement analysis but it was last improved in 2006. Can we create prediction models that beat these tasks?
- Project Tools: **Python** (libraries: Altair, sklearn, numpy, pandas, psycopg2), **PostgreSQL**.
- Dataset: [eICU Critical Care Dataset](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/) [(31 Tables, 457,325,320 rows, 50 gb)](https://mit-lcp.github.io/eicu-schema-spy/)
- [Academic Style Report](https://github.com/FernandoOCC/PersonalProjects/blob/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python/Data%20Science/eICU/Project%201/Introductory%20Machine%20Learning%20Benchmarks%20for%20Neuro%20ICU%20Patients%20on%20the%20eICU%20Critical%20Care%20Dataset.pdf)

#### Project At A Glance
- EDA Project exploring real student data in a college kinematics course. Data has been de-identified.
- Goal: Explore characteristics that could potentially impact a student's physics grade and understanding of Newtonian Mechanics
- Alternative Project: [Early Student Failure Detection Algorithm](https://github.com/FernandoOCC/PersonalProjects/edit/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python/Data%20Science/Early%20Student%20Failure%20Detection%20Algorithm/README.md)
