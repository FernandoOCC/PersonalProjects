# Python Projects

## Introduction

Since I began programming, Python has been my most trusted tool for creating statistical models. This personal preference is more due to the ease of use and understandability than due to the wide range of applications that it can be used for. In this section I will summarise some of my favourite projects I have worked on so far. 

# Project Examples

## Data Science
[<h3 align = "left">Project: Madrid House Price Prediction</h3>](https://github.com/FernandoOCC/PersonalProjects/Madrid_House_Price_Prediction/tree/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Madrid%20House%20%Price%20Prediction)
<h4 align=center> Mortality Predictions </h4>

**Mortality model prediction metric scores.** Classification models are matched up against APACHE IV / APACHE IVa predictions. Classification models were cross-validated 1000 times. We report the mean metric score and the standard deviation over all 1000 iterations. \*Note that standard deviation scores are not available for the APACHE prediction models.
#### Project At A Glance
- The APACHE (Acute Physiological And Chronic Health Evaluation) IV/IVa is a tool used to risk-adjust ICU patients for ICU performance benchmarking and quality improvement analysis but it was last improved in 2006. Can we create prediction models that beat these tasks?
- Project Tools: **Python** (libraries: Altair, sklearn, numpy, pandas, psycopg2), **PostgreSQL**.
- Dataset: [eICU Critical Care Dataset](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/) [(31 Tables, 457,325,320 rows, 50 gb)](https://mit-lcp.github.io/eicu-schema-spy/)
- [Academic Style Report](https://github.com/FernandoOCC/PersonalProjects/blob/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python/Data%20Science/eICU/Project%201/Introductory%20Machine%20Learning%20Benchmarks%20for%20Neuro%20ICU%20Patients%20on%20the%20eICU%20Critical%20Care%20Dataset.pdf)

#### Project At A Glance
- EDA Project exploring real student data in a college kinematics course. Data has been de-identified.
- Goal: Explore characteristics that could potentially impact a student's physics grade and understanding of Newtonian Mechanics
- Alternative Project: [Early Student Failure Detection Algorithm](https://github.com/FernandoOCC/PersonalProjects/edit/master/Personal%20Programming%20Projects/Python/Data%20Science/Early%20Student%20Failure%20Detection%20Algorithm/README.md)
